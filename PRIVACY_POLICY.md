# Privacy Policy for Neoscribe

**Effective Date:** February 25, 2026

Neoscribe ("we," "our," or "us") is dedicated to providing a high-performance text editing experience while respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding your information.

## 1. Local-First and Privacy-Focused

Neoscribe is a **local-first** application. This means:

- **No Cloud Sync:** Your files are stored directly on your device. We do not upload your text, notes, or code to any external servers.
- **Off-line Functionality:** The core features of the app function entirely without an internet connection.

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

- **No Personal Data:** We do not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share your name to use the app.
- **No Usage Tracking:** We do not use any analytics tools (such as Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics) to track how you use the application.
- **No Advertising:** There are no advertisements in Neoscribe, and we do not collect data for ad-targeting purposes.

## 3. Permissions

Neoscribe requests the following permissions for specific technical reasons:

- **Storage (Read/Write):** To allow you to open, edit, and save text files on your device.
- **Internet:** Used only for internal development tools (e.g. React Native debugging) and is not used to transmit user data in production.
- **Camera/Media (OCR):** If you use the Text Recognition (OCR) feature, the app processes the image locally on your device to extract text. Images are not uploaded to any server.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Neoscribe is built using Open Source software and libraries. These libraries operate within the scope of the app and do not collect or transmit your data to third parties.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
